# Restaurant Simulation - Optimization with Differential Evolution & Particle Swarm

This repository contains a restaurant simulation system that models various aspects of restaurant operations, such as customer arrivals, order handling, meal preparation, and inventory management. The system also incorporates optimization techniques like **Differential Evolution (DE)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** to maximize profit based on various factors.

## Files in this Repository

### 1. **diffev.py**
   - This script implements the **Differential Evolution (DE)** optimization algorithm. It is used for optimizing the parameters in the restaurant simulation to maximize profit or other performance metrics.
   
### 2. **diffevtest.py**
   - This is the test file for the `diffev.py` implementation. It contains test cases to validate the correctness and functionality of the Differential Evolution algorithm.

### 3. **particleswarm.py**
   - This script implements the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm. PSO is another optimization technique used to tune parameters in the restaurant simulation to improve performance.

### 4. **particleswarmtest.py**
   - This is the test file for the `particleswarm.py` implementation. It contains tests for the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to ensure its functionality and accuracy.

### 5. **simulation.py**
   - This file contains the core logic of the restaurant simulation. It models the arrival of customers, order placement, meal preparation, customer service, and other aspects of restaurant operations.

### 6. **simulatortest.py**
   - This is the test file for the `simulation.py` script. It includes test cases to ensure that the restaurant simulation behaves as expected under various scenarios.
